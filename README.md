# WarHawk Reversing

Some scripts to reverse the file formats used in [WarHawk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warhawk_(2007_video_game)).

The file formats used are as follows:
- [.rtt](docs/RTT.md) - Basically a DDS with a different header
- .vram - Multiple textures
- .ngp - Stores some texture data, the model data and presumably some others (animation, normal maps, uv maps etc.)
- .ptr - Has list of location for various model header and textures

## Contributing

Any help would be much appreciated.
